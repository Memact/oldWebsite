# Memact Website

Website is the public site and portal for Memact.

Memact is a playground where apps personalize around what users choose.

## What This Repo Owns

- Landing page and SEO assets.
- Sign in and account settings.
- App registration.
- API keys.
- Consent screens.
- Wiki.
- Playground feature catalog.
- Capture Sources UI.
- Playground feature UI.
- Schemas UI.
- Developer integration docs.
- Help and Learn pages.

## What This Repo Does Not Own

- Access checks, API key verification, or database RPC internals.
- Browser/page capture.
- Semantic inference.
- Schema packet formation.
- Durable memory storage.
- Feature runtime logic.

## Product Flow

```text
Website manages
-> Access checks
-> Capture receives
-> Inference understands
-> Schema organizes
-> Memory stores
-> Playground features run
-> Apps and users use results
```

Website is the console for users and developers. It is not part of the core
capture, inference, schema, memory, or feature pipeline.

The Website should explain Memact simply for users, then give developers exact
SDK/API steps. It should not pretend to run backend work in the browser.

## Current UI

The current UI is a minimal dark console built around `#00011B`, IBM Plex Sans,
compact cards, rounded controls, and consistent button hierarchy.

Authenticated dashboard:

- Dashboard shows apps, permissions, API keys, usage statistics, and Wiki links for active keys.
- `/Playground` shows real Playground features that can be connected to an app API key.
- `/Wiki` is the app-specific user wiki page. It is private unless a user explicitly creates a share link.
- Account shows identity, email/password actions, invites, and account metrics.
- Help uses short FAQs for users and developers.

Keep the UI direct and calm. Avoid generic SaaS filler and decorative copy that
does not help someone complete the task.

## Public Pages and Discovery

The site includes crawlable public discovery assets:

- `/`
- `/Learn`
- `/robots.txt`
- `/sitemap.xml`
- `/llms.txt`
- Open Graph and Twitter preview metadata
- JSON-LD for the web app
- PWA manifest basics

## Run Locally

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000/
```

Build:

```powershell
npm run build
```

## Configuration

Create `.env`:

```text
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-public-anon-key
# Optional override for non-standard deploy domains. Defaults to the current origin.
# VITE_AUTH_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/Dashboard
```

Only use the Supabase anon key in Website. Never put a service role key, GitHub
OAuth client secret, or private database secret in frontend code.

Before the portal works, apply the access-layer SQL migration from Access.

## App Integration Tutorial

After creating an API key, Website shows:

- a one-time API key
- copy and test controls
- a Connect Memact URL
- a Wiki URL
- a server-side SDK example

Normal app flow:

```text
developer creates app
-> chooses scopes and categories
-> user clicks "Connect Memact" inside the third-party app
-> Memact shows consent plus the app's Wiki page
-> user approves or cancels
-> approved apps receive a connection_id
-> app verifies API key + connection_id + scopes before sending events or running features
```

API keys identify the app. `connection_id` identifies the specific user consent.
Verification must pass both.

Customer apps should use the Memact SDK/API from their backend. They should not
call Supabase RPCs or configure Supabase keys.

## Consent and Wiki

The consent page must show what the app is asking to use and a Wiki link for
the same app.

Wiki explains:

- what the app can send
- what Memact may create or organize
- why the app wants it
- what features the app may use
- how long access lasts
- how the user can stop future access

Categories and permissions are boundaries, not the full story. If an app cannot
explain what it uses in plain language, the consent flow is not ready.
