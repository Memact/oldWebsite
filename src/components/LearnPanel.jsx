const BASIC_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is Memact?",
    answer: "Memact helps apps personalize better with context users control."
  },
  {
    question: "How does it work?",
    answer: "Apps ask to connect, send useful signals after permission, and receive only the context or feature output their access allows."
  },
  {
    question: "What can I review?",
    answer: "You can review what an app wants to use, what Memact may create from it, and what the app may receive back."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I disconnect an app?",
    answer: "Yes. Disconnecting an app stops future access for that app."
  }
]

const DEVELOPER_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "How does a developer start?",
    answer: "Register an app, keep the API key on the server, add a Connect Memact flow, then use the SDK/API to send capture events and run features after access is approved."
  },
  {
    question: "What does the SDK do?",
    answer: "The SDK helps apps send capture events, verify access, list available features, run a feature, and retrieve permitted schemas or memory summaries."
  },
  {
    question: "What are schema packets?",
    answer: "Schema packets are technical context structures Memact features can use. They belong in developer docs and advanced surfaces, not basic user consent copy."
  }
]

const FEATURE_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What are Memact features?",
    answer: "Features are tools built on Memact context, such as User Context Wiki, Cognitive Load, and Research Map."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the extension required?",
    answer: "No. Apps can send signals directly through Memact. The extension is optional for extra capture where the user chooses to enable it."
