const BASIC_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is Memact?",
    answer: "Memact helps apps personalize better with context users control."
  },
  {
    question: "Why would an app use Memact?",
    answer: "An app can send useful signals to Memact and get better context back later, with your permission."
  },
  {
    question: "Does an app get all my data?",
    answer: "No. An app only gets what you allow. You can review access and disconnect it."
  },
  {
    question: "What does Memact store?",
    answer: "Memact stores useful context created from app signals, user choices, and optional capture sources."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the browser extension required?",
    answer: "No. Apps that use Memact can work without it. The extension is optional for extra capture where you choose to use it."
  }
]

const CONTROL_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What can I control?",
    answer: "Which apps are connected, what they can use, and whether they keep access."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Data Transparency?",
    answer: "It shows what an app can use, what Memact creates from it, and what the app may receive."
  }
]

const DEVELOPER_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "How does an app connect to Memact?",
    answer: "Register an app, use the SDK/API, send capture events, and request features only after access is approved."
  },
  {
    question: "Where does the API key live?",
    answer: "On the server. Never in browser code, public repos, logs, or user-facing settings."
  },
  {
    question: "What are features?",
    answer: "Features are tools built on Memact context, like a user-context wiki, research map, or cognitive load estimate."
  }
