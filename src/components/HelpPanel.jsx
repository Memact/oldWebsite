const USER_BASIC_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is Memact?",
    answer: "Memact helps you decide how apps know you, because your activity is not your identity."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Notebook?",
    answer: "The Notebook is your editable page about you. You can add things yourself, approve what apps suggest, edit entries, delete them, or share selected parts later."
  },
  {
    question: "What can the Notebook include?",
    answer: "It can include preferences, projects, reading habits, shopping interests, learning topics, work style, accessibility needs, usernames you prefer, and anything else you add or approve."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do apps ask first?",
    answer: "Because an app should not use or add memory about you without permission."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to install anything?",
    answer: "No. Apps can connect to Memact through the SDK/API. The important part is that you approve what the app can use or add."
  },
  {
    question: "Does an app get all my data?",
    answer: "No. An app only gets what you allow. You can review access and disconnect it."
  }
]

const USER_CONTROL_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What can I control?",
    answer: "You can control which apps are connected, what they can use, what they can add, and whether they keep access."
  },
  {
    question: "Can apps write to my Notebook?",
    answer: "Only if you allow it. Important entries can stay pending until you accept, edit, or reject them."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I add my own memory?",
    answer: "Yes. You can add entries like \"I prefer short summaries\" or \"I am working on Memact.\" User-added entries are treated as stronger than app guesses."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I share my memory?",
    answer: "Only selected entries. Private entries stay private by default."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when an app is wrong?",
    answer: "You can edit the entry, reject it, delete it, or block the app from writing more memory."
  }

const DEVELOPER_BASIC_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is Memact?",
    answer: "Memact helps apps personalize around what users choose, without hiding what they know."
  },
  {
    question: "How does an app connect to Memact?",
    answer: "Register an app, ask the user for access, keep the API key on your server, then use the SDK/API to suggest memory or read allowed memory."
  },
  {
    question: "What can my app see?",
    answer: "Only what the user allowed for your app. You can see your app's access, API keys, and memory proposals, not the user's full Notebook."
  },
  {
    question: "How do scopes and categories work?",
    answer: "Scopes say what your app can do. Categories say what kind of memory your app is asking to use."
  }
]

const DEVELOPER_CONTEXT_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is Context?",
    answer: "Context is the open-source category system developers use. It helps turn app input into readable memory suggestions a user can accept, edit, reject, or delete."
  },
  {
    question: "Can my app suggest memory entries?",
    answer: "Yes, if the user allows it. Important writes should stay pending until the user accepts, edits, or rejects them."
  },
  {
    question: "Can platform bots use Memact?",
    answer: "Yes, with explicit consent. Bot activity should be labeled clearly and should only create memory the user can review."
  },
  {
    question: "Where does the API key live?",
    answer: "On your server. Never put a Memact API key in browser code, public repos, logs, or user-facing settings."
  }
